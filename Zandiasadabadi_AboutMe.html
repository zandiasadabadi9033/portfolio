              <p><big>I am born in Tehran, Iran. As a kid growing up, I have always been excited to learn and take on new journeys. I learned how to play chess as a 5-year-old and ever since I have not stopped playing. 
               In my opinion, playing chess not only made me think more critically, but it also turned me into a competitive person. I am currently a senior at Dublin High School in Dublin, California. I plan to attend a 4-year university once I graduate from high school.
               I had previously decided to major in Computer Science as I took the programming class CSE (Computer Software Engineering). In the result, I am familiar with programming and coding languages such as HTML & CSS, Python, and JavaScript. Even though my family has a history of having high-paying IT jobs,
               I figured out that I would rather study Business instead. I can speak 3 languages (English, Persian, Arabic) and am currently learning the 4th one (Swedish).</big></p>
